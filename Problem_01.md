**Challenge #1: Create a Student Record REST API with Spring Boot**

ðŸ“š **Problem Statement:**

You are tasked with building a RESTful API for managing student records using Spring Boot. The API should allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student records. Each student record should have the following attributes:

- Student ID
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email Address

Your task is to design the API, implement the necessary endpoints, and write JUnit test cases to ensure its functionality.

ðŸ§ª **JUnit Test Case:**

Write a JUnit test case that covers the following scenarios:

1. Create a new student record and verify its existence.
2. Retrieve a student record by ID and ensure its correctness.
3. Update an existing student's information and confirm the changes.
4. Delete a student record and ensure it's removed from the system.

Your code should be well-organized, follow best practices, and include proper error handling.
